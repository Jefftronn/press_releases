    <p><img src="/portal/common/imagelibrary/icaf_head logo_original.jpg" width="140" class="img"/><strong>Certiport (<a href="http://www.certiport.com" class="CommandLink">www.certiport.com</a>)</strong>, a Pearson VUE business, the leading test delivery solution provider for the global workforce and academic markets, today announces the non-profit client for the <a href="http://www.acachampionship.com/" class="CommandLink" title="2016 Adobe Certified Associate World Championship (ACAWC)">2016 Adobe Certified Associate World Championship (ACAWC)</a> will be the <a href="https://www.icaf.org/" class="CommandLink" title="International Child Art Foundation (ICAF)">International Child Art Foundation (ICAF)</a>, an organization that works to enhance academic performance and imbue global citizenship by nurturing children's creativity and developing their empathy.</p>

    <p>"We are impressed with the ACA World Championship and look forward to participating with Adobe and Certiport as the non-profit client and to help judge the final projects,” said Dr. Ashfaq Ishaq, Founder and Chair of ICAF. “Perhaps one of the designs will inspire a future campaign for our organization. We welcome the opportunity to spread the word about ICAF and our mission to inspire creativity in young people.”</p>

    <p>Certiport and Adobe sponsor the ACAWC and expect more than 135,000 entrants worldwide, with more than 20 countries represented at the final round of the ACA World Championship in Orlando, Florida August 7-10, 2016.  The ACA World Championship is designed to showcase digital communications skills and promote industry certification. In the final round of competition, students will receive instructions, project requirements and assets to complete a real-world design challenge for ICAF.</p>

    <p>“We are pleased to work with ICAF, and their focus on nurturing creativity integrates with our focus on giving students the skills to effectively use Adobe software as a creative and professional outlet,” said Aaron Osmond, general manager, Certiport, a Pearson VUE business.  “The work the ACA finalists do for our non-profits is always inspiring and we look forward to this year’s competition.”</p> 

    <p>For their final design challenge, ACA World Championship student competitors will be asked to envision that they have been hired by ICAF to create a project using Adobe software. They will be given instructions and visual assets such as ICAF’s logo and imagery and will be able to use Adobe Photoshop® CC, Adobe Illustrator® CC and Adobe InDesign® CC, key components of Adobe Creative Cloud to create the final project.</p>
    
    <p>"At Adobe, we believe in igniting creativity in young people for positive change, and ICAF and its mission align perfectly with this goal," said Tacy Trowbridge, Education Programs lead, Adobe. “The ACAWC gives student competitors an opportunity to showcase their talent, while creating projects that have the potential for being used by ICAF in the real world.”</p>
    
    <p>A first ($5,000), second ($2,500) and third ($1,000) place ACA World Champion will be chosen based on a panel of judges reviewing the final design projects.
